# Campus_Mart
The code is a Python Tkinter-based application for a simple buy-and-sell platform. It connects to a MySQL database to manage user accounts, categories, and items. The application has several features:

Database Setup: Creates and connects to two MySQL databases: one for user data and another for categories and items.
Login and Signup: Provides a login and signup system where users can create an account or log in to an existing one.
Buying and Selling: Users can choose to buy or sell items. When selling, users can select a category or add a new one, then enter item details (name, price, description). When buying, users can select a category to view items and their details.
GUI: The interface is designed with Tkinter, including image backgrounds and various frames for different stages of interaction.
The code includes navigation between these sections and error handling for login/signup mismatches.
